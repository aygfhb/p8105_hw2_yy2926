Problem 1

``` r
NYC_Tranist <- read.csv("~/data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv")
NYC_Tranist <- janitor::clean_names(NYC_Tranist)
NYC_Retain <- select(NYC_Tranist,line:vending,ada,ada_notes)
NYC_Retain$entry <- ifelse(NYC_Retain$entry == "YES",TRUE,FALSE)
```

\*\*\* This dataset contains several variables which state the information about the specific station. Variables include the name, location, and entrance or vending facilities of the station. So far, we cleaned some redundant variables, including the geographic location of the station, the exit of the station. Also, I changed the name of the variable which makes it more succinct. The dimension of the resulting dataset is 1868. I think these data are tidy since we have variables in columns, observations in Rows, and every value has a cell.

\*\*\* Q1 How many distinct stations are there? Note that stations are identified both by name and by line (e.g. 125th St A/B/C/D; 125st 1; 125st 4/5); the distinct function may be useful here.

\*\*\* A1: There are 465 distinct stations according to both name and line.

\*\*\* Q2: How many stations are ADA compliant?

\*\*\* A2: There are 468 stations are ADA compliant.

\*\*\* Q3: What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance?

\*\*\* A3: The proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow entrance is 31.3035714

Reform Data

``` r
NYC_Retain = unite(NYC_Retain,Route_name,route1:route11,sep='',remove=TRUE)
NYC_Retain$Route_name = gsub("NA","",NYC_Retain$Route_name)
NYC_Retain = mutate(NYC_Retain,Route_number = nchar(NYC_Retain$Route_name)) %>%
select(line:station_longitude,Route_name,Route_number,everything())
```

\*\*\* Q3: How many distinct stations serve the A train?

\*\*\* A3: There are 273 stations serve the A train.

\*\*\* Q4: Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

\*\*\* A4:

Problem 2

``` r
Trash_Wheel <- read_excel("~/data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx",range=cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
janitor::clean_names()%>%
filter(!is.na(dumpster))%>%
mutate(sports_balls=as.integer(round(sports_balls)))
```

``` r
Precipitation_2017 <- read_excel("~/data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx",sheet="2017 Precipitation",range="A2:B14") %>%
janitor::clean_names()%>%
filter(!is.na(total))%>%
mutate(year=2017)%>%
select(year,month,total)
```

``` r
Precipitation_2016 <- read_excel("~/data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2017-9-26.xlsx",sheet="2016 Precipitation",range="A2:B14") %>%
janitor::clean_names()%>%
filter(!is.na(total))%>%
mutate(year=2016)%>%
select(year,month,total)
```

``` r
Precipitation_Combine <- merge(Precipitation_2016,Precipitation_2017,by ="month",all=TRUE)%>%
mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

\*\*\* Q1: Be sure to note the number of observations in both resulting datasets, and give examples of key variables.

\*\*\* Q2:For available data, what was the total precipitation in 2017?

\*\*\* A2: The total precitation in 2017 is 29.93

\*\*\* Q3:What was the median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2016?

\*\*\* A3: The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2016 is 26

Problem 3

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss_data <- brfss_smart2010 %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>%
select(-class, -topic, -question, -sample_size, -(confidence_limit_low:geo_location)) %>%
spread(key=response,value=data_value) %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
mutate(Proportion = excellent+very_good)
```

Q1: How many unique locations are included in the dataset? Is every state represented? What state is observed the most?

A1: There are 404 unique locations are included in the dataset. There are 51 states covered in the data. Yes, every state is represented. NY state is observed the most with 146 times.

Q2: In 2002, what is the median of the “Excellent” response value?

A2: The median of the "Excellent" response value is NA Q3: Make a histogram of “Excellent” response values in the year 2002.

``` r
ggplot(subset(brfss_data, year == 2002),aes(x=excellent))+geom_histogram()
```

    ## `stat_bin()` using `bins = 30`. Pick better value with `binwidth`.

    ## Warning: Removed 2 rows containing non-finite values (stat_bin).

![](p8105_hw2_yy2926_files/figure-markdown_github/Problem3_histogram-1.png) Q4: Make a scatterplot showing the proportion of “Excellent” response values in New York County and Queens County (both in NY State) in each year from 2002 to 2010.
